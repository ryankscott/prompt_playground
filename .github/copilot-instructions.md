# Project general coding standards

## Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Prefix private class members with underscore (\_)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants

## Error Handling

- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Always log errors with contextual information

## TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow functional programming principles where possible
- Use interfaces for data structures and type definitions
- Prefer immutable data (const, readonly)
- Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators

## React Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the React hooks rules (no conditional hooks)
- Use React.FC type for components with children
- Keep components small and focused
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Use fetch for HTTP requests
- Use Vitest for unit testing
- Use shadcn/ui for UI components
- Use pnpm as a package manager
